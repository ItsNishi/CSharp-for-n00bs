# Introductions

C# is an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft in 2000.

It is also a managed language, which means developers do not have to worry about issues such as memory management. Unlike unmanaged languages like C++,  where memory has to be manually allocated and freed, C# features a garbage collector that handles this for you automatically.

C# compiles into an Intermediate Language (IL), which, when executed, runs inside a Common Language Runtime (CLR). This CLR translates the IL into machine code on the fly and handles the aforementioned management.



C# was originally designed to run only on Windows, but now it is open source and cross-platform.



C# and .NET are often used synonymously, but they are different things. .NET is effectively a set of programming APIs, which exposes various functionality as written by Microsoft. C# is a programming language that is built on top of .NET - as in, C# is used to call .NET APIs.

F# and Visual Basic are built on top of .NET



.NET Framework was the original version and only ran on Windows.

.NET Standard was released to support implementations such as Silverlight. Silverlight was designed for web and mobile. - It does not have the full range of .NET Framework API calls.

.NET Standard only exposes generic APIs that are not platform-specific.

.Net core was a new, cross-platform implementation that ran on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It was designed as the successor to the .NET Framework, which no longer sees new versions.

.NET is a rebrand of .NET Core. The last version of .NET Core is 3.1, and the first version of .NET was 5. They skipped over 4 to avoid confusion with .NET Framework which ended at version 4.8
